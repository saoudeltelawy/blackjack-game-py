cd simple-blackjack-game
Run the Game:

Bash

python blackjack.py  # Assuming the main script is named blackjack.py
This will start the Blackjack game allowing you to play against the dealer.

Example Output:

Your cards: [5, 10], current score: 15
Dealer's first card: 8
Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: y
Your cards: [5, 10, 3], current score: 18
Dealer's cards: [8, 9], current score: 17
You win!
Game Rules:

You vs. Dealer: Your goal is to have a higher score than the dealer without going over 21.
Get Close to 21: Add the values of your cards to get as close as possible to 21.
Number cards are worth their face value (e.g., 5 = 5 points).
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
Aces can be worth 1 or 11 (choose whichever benefits you more).
Your Turn:
Start with 2 cards.
Choose:
Hit: Take another card.
Stand: Keep your current total.
Dealer's Turn:
Dealer starts with 2 cards as well.
Dealer must draw cards until they reach 17 or higher.
Who Wins?:
If your total is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win.
If you go over 21 (bust), you lose.
If the dealer goes over 21, you win.
If both scores are equal, it's a tie.
Enjoy playing Blackjack!
